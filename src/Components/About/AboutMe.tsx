    <AboutMeStyle>
      <p>
        I have alway being fascinated with the internet and the evolution of the
        web, from growing up in a time when not all websites were
        responsive and didn't fit our phone screens , to experiencing the
        dynamics of the web today. I decided to understand how websites work and
        that lead me to Html and css. Gradually my passion for the web grew and
        it lead me to Javascript, React and Typescript. Now I build websites and
        web apps that birth the ideas of products owners.

      <p>
        I am proficient in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, TypeScript and I use
        tools like Tailwind CSS and Sass. Comfortable with a collaborative
        workflow using GitHub, Netlify, Vercel, Slack, Confluence, and Jira.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I've had the pleasure of bringing ideas to life through websites and web
        applications. Each project is more than code, it's a solution that
        resonates with users and fulfills the vision of product owners.
