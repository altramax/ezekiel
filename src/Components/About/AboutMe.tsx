      <p>
        In, 2020 I became fascinated with the internet and decided to understand
        how websites work and that lead me to Html and css. Gradually my passion
        for the web grew and it lead me to Javascript, React and Typescript. I
        went on to build websites and web application that birthed the ideas of
        products owners.

      <br />
      <p>
        Proficient in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, TypeScript. Skillful use of
        tools like Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. Comfortable with a
        collaborative workflow using GitHub, Netlify, Vercel, Slack, Confluence,
        and Jira.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I've had the pleasure of bringing ideas to life through websites and web
        applications. Each project is more than code; it's a solution that
        resonates with users and fulfills the vision of product owners.

      <p>
        I take pride in writing codes that not only function seamlessly but also
        contribute to elegant and user-friendly designs. Balancing form and
        function is at the core of my development philosophy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I take pleasure in writing codes that seamless user experiences and When
        I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me unwinding with a good movie.
        It's my go-to relaxation and a source of inspiration.
